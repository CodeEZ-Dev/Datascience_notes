    "### Functional Programming in Python\n",
    "\n",
    "Functional programming is a programming paradigm where programs are constructed by applying and composing functions. It emphasizes the use of functions as the primary building blocks of the program and treats functions as first-class citizens. Python supports functional programming features, allowing the creation and manipulation of functions in various ways.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1. Lambda Forms\n",
    "\n",
    "Lambda functions are small anonymous functions defined using the `lambda` keyword. They can have any number of arguments but only one expression. The expression is evaluated and returned. Lambda functions are often used for short, simple operations.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Syntax:**\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "lambda arguments: expression\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**Example:**\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "add = lambda x, y: x + y\n",
    "print(add(2, 3))  # Prints: 5\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2. List Comprehension\n",
    "\n",
    "List comprehensions provide a concise way to create lists. They consist of brackets containing an expression followed by a `for` clause, and can include multiple `for` or `if` clauses.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Syntax:**\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "[expression for item in iterable if condition]\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**Example:**\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "squares = [x**2 for x in range(10)]\n",
    "print(squares)  # Prints: [0, 1, 4, 9, 16, 25, 36, 49, 64, 81]\n",
    "\n",
    "even_squares = [x**2 for x in range(10) if x % 2 == 0]\n",
    "print(even_squares)  # Prints: [0, 4, 16, 36, 64]\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### 3. map\n",
    "\n",
    "The `map` function applies a given function to all items in an input list (or any other iterable) and returns a map object (which can be converted to a list).\n",
    "\n",
    "**Syntax:**\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "map(function, iterable)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**Example:**\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "def square(x):\n",
    "    return x ** 2\n",
    "\n",
    "numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]\n",
    "squared_numbers = map(square, numbers)\n",
    "print(list(squared_numbers))  # Prints: [1, 4, 9, 16, 25]\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Using a lambda function with `map`:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]\n",
    "squared_numbers = map(lambda x: x ** 2, numbers)\n",
    "print(list(squared_numbers))  # Prints: [1, 4, 9, 16, 25]\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### 4. reduce\n",
    "\n",
    "The `reduce` function is used to apply a function cumulatively to the items of an iterable, reducing the iterable to a single value. `reduce` is available in the `functools` module.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Syntax:**\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "from functools import reduce\n",
    "reduce(function, iterable)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**Example:**\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "from functools import reduce\n",
    "\n",
    "def add(x, y):\n",
    "    return x + y\n",
    "\n",
    "numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]\n",
    "sum_of_numbers = reduce(add, numbers)\n",
    "print(sum_of_numbers)  # Prints: 15\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Using a lambda function with `reduce`:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]\n",
    "sum_of_numbers = reduce(lambda x, y: x + y, numbers)\n",
    "print(sum_of_numbers)  # Prints: 15\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### 5. filter\n",
    "\n",
    "The `filter` function constructs an iterator from elements of an iterable for which a function returns true.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Syntax:**\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "filter(function, iterable)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**Example:**\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "def is_even(x):\n",
    "    return x % 2 == 0\n",
    "\n",
    "numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10]\n",
    "even_numbers = filter(is_even, numbers)\n",
    "print(list(even_numbers))  # Prints: [2, 4, 6, 8, 10]\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Using a lambda function with `filter`:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10]\n",
    "even_numbers = filter(lambda x: x % 2 == 0, numbers)\n",
    "print(list(even_numbers))  # Prints: [2, 4, 6, 8, 10]\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "These tools allow Python to support functional programming by enabling concise and expressive ways to work with data and functions."
