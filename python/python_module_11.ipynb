    "### Introduction to Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) in Python\n",
    "\n",
    "Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) is a programming paradigm that organizes software design around objects and data, rather than actions and logic. In Python, everything is an object, and you can create and use objects to model real-world entities.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Class Definition Syntax\n",
    "\n",
    "A class is a blueprint for creating objects (instances) that share attributes and behaviors. The `class` keyword is used to define a new class.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Syntax:**\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "class ClassName:\n",
    "    # Class attributes and methods\n",
    "    pass\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**Example:**\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "class Person:\n",
    "    def __init__(self, name, age):\n",
    "        self.name = name   # Instance variable\n",
    "        self.age = age     # Instance variable\n",
    "        \n",
    "    def greet(self):\n",
    "        return f\"Hello, my name is {self.name} and I am {self.age} years old.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "# Creating instances of the Person class\n",
    "person1 = Person(\"Alice\", 30)\n",
    "person2 = Person(\"Bob\", 25)\n",
    "\n",
    "print(person1.greet())  # Prints: Hello, my name is Alice and I am 30 years old.\n",
    "print(person2.greet())  # Prints: Hello, my name is Bob and I am 25 years old.\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Class Objects, Instance Objects, Method Objects; Instantiation\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Class Objects:** A class object is a blueprint from which instances are created.\n",
    "- **Instance Objects:** Instance objects are specific instances created from a class.\n",
    "- **Method Objects:** Method objects are functions defined inside a class that operate on instances of that class.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Instantiation:** The process of creating an instance of a class is called instantiation.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the example above:\n",
    "- `Person` is the class object.\n",
    "- `person1` and `person2` are instance objects.\n",
    "- `greet` is a method object defined inside the `Person` class.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Inheritance\n",
    "\n",
    "Inheritance allows one class (subclass) to inherit attributes and methods from another class (superclass). This promotes code reuse and enables hierarchical relationships between classes.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Syntax:**\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "class SubClassName(SuperClassName):\n",
    "    # Attributes and methods of the subclass\n",
    "    pass\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**Example:**\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "class Student(Person):\n",
    "    def __init__(self, name, age, student_id):\n",
    "        super().__init__(name, age)\n",
    "        self.student_id = student_id\n",
    "        \n",
    "    def study(self):\n",
    "        return f\"{self.name} is studying.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "student = Student(\"Charlie\", 20, \"12345\")\n",
    "print(student.greet())  # Inherits greet() method from Person class\n",
    "print(student.study())  # Prints: Charlie is studying.\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Data Member – Class variable/Instance Variable\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Instance Variables:** These are variables that are unique to each instance of a class. They are defined inside methods with the `self` keyword.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Class Variables (Data Member):** These are variables shared by all instances of a class. They are defined outside any method in the class body.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Example:**\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "class Circle:\n",
    "    pi = 3.14  # Class variable\n",
    "\n",
    "    def __init__(self, radius):\n",
    "        self.radius = radius  # Instance variable\n",
    "\n",
    "    def area(self):\n",
    "        return self.pi * self.radius ** 2\n",
    "\n",
    "circle1 = Circle(5)\n",
    "circle2 = Circle(7)\n",
    "\n",
    "print(circle1.area())  # Prints: 78.5\n",
    "print(circle2.area())  # Prints: 153.86\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Function Overloading\n",
    "\n",
    "Python does not support function overloading in the traditional sense (as in languages like C++ or Java), where multiple functions can have the same name but different parameters. Instead, you can achieve similar behavior using default arguments or variable-length arguments.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Example using default arguments:**\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "class MathOperations:\n",
    "    def add(self, a, b=0):\n",
    "        return a + b\n",
    "\n",
    "math = MathOperations()\n",
    "print(math.add(2, 3))  # Prints: 5\n",
    "print(math.add(2))     # Prints: 2 (b defaults to 0)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Operator Overloading\n",
    "\n",
    "Operator overloading allows you to define how operators behave for objects of a class. In Python, operator overloading is achieved by defining special methods (e.g., `__add__` for `+`, `__sub__` for `-`, etc.).\n",
    "\n",
    "**Example (adding two objects):**\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "class Point:\n",
    "    def __init__(self, x, y):\n",
    "        self.x = x\n",
    "        self.y = y\n",
    "        \n",
    "    def __add__(self, other):\n",
    "        return Point(self.x + other.x, self.y + other.y)\n",
    "\n",
    "point1 = Point(1, 2)\n",
    "point2 = Point(3, 4)\n",
    "result = point1 + point2\n",
    "print(result.x, result.y)  # Prints: 4 6\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "In this example, `__add__` method defines how the `+` operator behaves for instances of the `Point` class.\n",
    "\n"

    "## Types of Inheritances\n",
    "\n",
    "In Python, object-oriented programming (OOP) supports various forms of inheritance: single, multiple, hybrid, and hierarchical. Let's explore each with examples.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Single Inheritance\n",
    "\n",
    "Single inheritance involves a single base class and a single derived class. The derived class inherits attributes and methods from the base class.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Example:**\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "# Base class\n",
    "class Animal:\n",
    "    def sound(self):\n",
    "        return \"Some sound\"\n",
    "\n",
    "# Derived class inheriting from Animal\n",
    "class Dog(Animal):\n",
    "    def sound(self):\n",
    "        return \"Bark\"\n",
    "\n",
    "# Creating an instance of Dog\n",
    "dog = Dog()\n",
    "print(dog.sound())  # Outputs: Bark\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "In this example:\n",
    "- `Animal` is the base class.\n",
    "- `Dog` is the derived class that inherits from `Animal`.\n",
    "- `Dog` overrides the `sound()` method of `Animal` to return \"Bark\".\n",
    "\n",
    "### Multiple Inheritance\n",
    "\n",
    "Multiple inheritance involves inheriting from multiple base classes. This allows a class to inherit attributes and methods from more than one parent class.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Example:**\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "# Base class 1\n",
    "class Bird:\n",
    "    def sound(self):\n",
    "        return \"Chirp\"\n",
    "\n",
    "# Base class 2\n",
    "class Mammal:\n",
    "    def sound(self):\n",
    "        return \"Roar\"\n",
    "\n",
    "# Derived class inheriting from Bird and Mammal\n",
    "class Bat(Bird, Mammal):\n",
    "    pass\n",
    "\n",
    "# Creating an instance of Bat\n",
    "bat = Bat()\n",
    "print(bat.sound())  # Outputs: Chirp\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "In this example:\n",
    "- `Bat` inherits from both `Bird` and `Mammal`.\n",
    "- Since `Bat` inherits `sound()` from `Bird` first in the method resolution order (MRO), it returns \"Chirp\".\n",
    "\n",
    "### Hybrid Inheritance\n",
    "\n",
    "Hybrid inheritance combines different types of inheritance, typically involving both single and multiple inheritance within the same hierarchy.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Example:**\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "# Base class\n",
    "class Animal:\n",
    "    def sound(self):\n",
    "        return \"Some sound\"\n",
    "\n",
    "# Single inheritance\n",
    "class Dog(Animal):\n",
    "    def sound(self):\n",
    "        return \"Bark\"\n",
    "\n",
    "# Multiple inheritance\n",
    "class Bat(Animal, Bird):\n",
    "    pass\n",
    "\n",
    "# Creating instances\n",
    "dog = Dog()\n",
    "bat = Bat()\n",
    "print(dog.sound())  # Outputs: Bark\n",
    "print(bat.sound())  # Outputs: Some sound\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "In this example:\n",
    "- `Dog` demonstrates single inheritance from `Animal`, overriding `sound()` to return \"Bark\".\n",
    "- `Bat` shows multiple inheritance from `Animal` and `Bird`, inheriting `sound()` from `Animal`.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Hierarchical Inheritance\n",
    "\n",
    "Hierarchical inheritance involves multiple derived classes inheriting from a single base class.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Example:**\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "# Base class\n",
    "class Animal:\n",
    "    def sound(self):\n",
    "        return \"Some sound\"\n",
    "\n",
    "# Derived classes inheriting from Animal\n",
    "class Dog(Animal):\n",
    "    def sound(self):\n",
    "        return \"Bark\"\n",
    "\n",
    "class Cat(Animal):\n",
    "    def sound(self):\n",
    "        return \"Meow\"\n",
    "\n",
    "# Creating instances\n",
    "dog = Dog()\n",
    "cat = Cat()\n",
    "print(dog.sound())  # Outputs: Bark\n",
    "print(cat.sound())  # Outputs: Meow\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "In this example:\n",
    "- Both `Dog` and `Cat` inherit `sound()` from `Animal`, but each overrides it to return its specific sound.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Summary\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Single Inheritance:** One derived class inherits from one base class.\n",
    "- **Multiple Inheritance:** One derived class inherits from multiple base classes.\n",
    "- **Hybrid Inheritance:** Combines different types of inheritance within the same hierarchy.\n",
    "- **Hierarchical Inheritance:** Multiple derived classes inherit from a single base class."
