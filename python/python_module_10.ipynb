    "### Exception Handling in Python\n",
    "\n",
    "Exception handling in Python allows you to manage errors that may occur during the execution of your programs, making them more robust and user-friendly. Let's explore exception handling concepts in detail with examples.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Handling Exceptions\n",
    "\n",
    "In Python, exceptions are events that disrupt the normal flow of a program. They are typically raised when the program encounters an error. Python provides several built-in exceptions, such as `ZeroDivisionError`, `TypeError`, and `ValueError`. You can handle these exceptions using the `try-except` block.\n",
    "\n",
    "### try-except\n",
    "\n",
    "The `try-except` block is used to catch and handle exceptions. The code that might raise an exception is placed inside the `try` block, and the code to handle the exception is placed inside the `except` block.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Syntax:**\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "try:\n",
    "    # Code that might raise an exception\n",
    "except ExceptionType:\n",
    "    # Code to handle the exception\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**Example:**\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "try:\n",
    "    result = 10 / 0\n",
    "except ZeroDivisionError:\n",
    "    print(\"You can't divide by zero!\")\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "In this example, attempting to divide by zero raises a `ZeroDivisionError`, which is caught and handled by printing a message.\n",
    "\n",
    "### else Clause\n",
    "\n",
    "The `else` clause can be used with the `try-except` block to define code that should run if no exceptions are raised in the `try` block.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Syntax:**\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "try:\n",
    "    # Code that might raise an exception\n",
    "except ExceptionType:\n",
    "    # Code to handle the exception\n",
    "else:\n",
    "    # Code to execute if no exception was raised\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**Example:**\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "try:\n",
    "    result = 10 / 2\n",
    "except ZeroDivisionError:\n",
    "    print(\"You can't divide by zero!\")\n",
    "else:\n",
    "    print(\"The result is:\", result)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "In this example, since no exception is raised, the code inside the `else` block is executed, printing the result.\n",
    "\n",
    "### finally Clause\n",
    "\n",
    "The `finally` clause can be used to define code that should run no matter what, whether an exception is raised or not. This is useful for cleanup actions, such as closing files or releasing resources.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Syntax:**\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "try:\n",
    "    # Code that might raise an exception\n",
    "except ExceptionType:\n",
    "    # Code to handle the exception\n",
    "else:\n",
    "    # Code to execute if no exception was raised\n",
    "finally:\n",
    "    # Code to execute no matter what\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**Example:**\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "try:\n",
    "    file = open('example.txt', 'r')\n",
    "    content = file.read()\n",
    "except FileNotFoundError:\n",
    "    print(\"The file was not found!\")\n",
    "else:\n",
    "    print(content)\n",
    "finally:\n",
    "    file.close()\n",
    "    print(\"File is closed.\")\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "In this example, the `finally` block ensures that the file is closed, regardless of whether an exception was raised.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Raising Exceptions\n",
    "\n",
    "You can raise exceptions in your code using the `raise` statement. This is useful when you want to trigger an exception under specific conditions.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Syntax:**\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "raise ExceptionType(\"Error message\")\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**Example:**\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "def check_age(age):\n",
    "    if age < 0:\n",
    "        raise ValueError(\"Age cannot be negative!\")\n",
    "    return age\n",
    "\n",
    "try:\n",
    "    age = check_age(-5)\n",
    "except ValueError as e:\n",
    "    print(e)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "In this example, if the age is negative, a `ValueError` is raised with a custom error message.\n",
    "\n",
    "### User-defined Exceptions\n",
    "\n",
    "You can create your own exceptions by defining a new class that inherits from the built-in `Exception` class. This is useful for handling specific error conditions unique to your application.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Syntax:**\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "class MyCustomError(Exception):\n",
    "    pass\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**Example:**\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "class NegativeAgeError(Exception):\n",
    "    def __init__(self, age, message=\"Age cannot be negative!\"):\n",
    "        self.age = age\n",
    "        self.message = message\n",
    "        super().__init__(self.message)\n",
    "\n",
    "def check_age(age):\n",
    "    if age < 0:\n",
    "        raise NegativeAgeError(age)\n",
    "    return age\n",
    "\n",
    "try:\n",
    "    age = check_age(-5)\n",
    "except NegativeAgeError as e:\n",
    "    print(f\"Error: {e.message} (Age: {e.age})\")\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "In this example, a custom exception `NegativeAgeError` is defined and raised if the age is negative. The custom exception carries additional information about the error.\n",
    "\n",
