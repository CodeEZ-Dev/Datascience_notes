    "### File Handling and OS Interactions in Python\n",
    "\n",
    "Python provides several built-in functions and modules for interacting with the file system and performing various file handling operations. These include opening files, reading and writing data, closing files, and performing directory operations. Let's go through these concepts one by one.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Opening a File\n",
    "\n",
    "To open a file in Python, you use the `open()` function, which returns a file object. The `open()` function requires a filename and a mode indicating how the file is to be opened. Common modes include:\n",
    "- `'r'` for reading (default)\n",
    "- `'w'` for writing (truncates the file if it exists)\n",
    "- `'a'` for appending\n",
    "- `'b'` for binary mode\n",
    "- `'+'` for updating (reading and writing)\n",
    "\n",
    "**Example:**\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "file = open('example.txt', 'r')  # Open file for reading\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Reading from a File, Writing to a File\n",
    "\n",
    "**Reading from a File:**\n",
    "\n",
    "You can read data from a file using several methods:\n",
    "- `read(size)` reads the specified number of bytes from the file.\n",
    "- `readline()` reads a single line from the file.\n",
    "- `readlines()` reads all lines from the file and returns them as a list.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Example:**\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "file = open('example.txt', 'r')\n",
    "content = file.read()  # Reads the entire file\n",
    "print(content)\n",
    "file.close()\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**Writing to a File:**\n",
    "\n",
    "You can write data to a file using the `write()` method. If the file does not exist, it will be created.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Example:**\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "file = open('example.txt', 'w')\n",
    "file.write(\"Hello, World!\\n\")\n",
    "file.close()\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Closing a File\n",
    "\n",
    "It's important to close a file after you're done with it to free up system resources. You can close a file using the `close()` method.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Example:**\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "file = open('example.txt', 'r')\n",
    "content = file.read()\n",
    "file.close()  # Close the file\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Alternatively, you can use the `with` statement, which automatically closes the file after the block of code is executed:\n",
    "\n",
    "**Example:**\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "with open('example.txt', 'r') as file:\n",
    "    content = file.read()\n",
    "    print(content)\n",
    "# No need to explicitly close the file\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Reading Directories & Other Basic Directory Operations\n",
    "\n",
    "Python's `os` module provides functions for interacting with the operating system, including file and directory operations.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Getting the Current Working Directory:**\n",
    "\n",
    "Use `os.getcwd()` to get the current working directory.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Example:**\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "import os\n",
    "\n",
    "current_directory = os.getcwd()\n",
    "print(current_directory)  # Prints the current working directory\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**Creating a Directory:**\n",
    "\n",
    "Use `os.mkdir()` to create a new directory.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Example:**\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "os.mkdir('new_directory')  # Creates a directory named 'new_directory'\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**Changing the Current Working Directory:**\n",
    "\n",
    "Use `os.chdir()` to change the current working directory.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Example:**\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "os.chdir('new_directory')  # Changes the current working directory to 'new_directory'\n",
    "print(os.getcwd())  # Verify the change\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**Listing Directory Contents:**\n",
    "\n",
    "Use `os.listdir()` to list the contents of a directory.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Example:**\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "contents = os.listdir('.')\n",
    "print(contents)  # Prints a list of files and directories in the current directory\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Renaming & Deleting Files\n",
    "\n",
    "**Renaming a File:**\n",
    "\n",
    "Use `os.rename()` to rename a file.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Example:**\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "os.rename('example.txt', 'renamed_example.txt')  # Renames 'example.txt' to 'renamed_example.txt'\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**Deleting a File:**\n",
    "\n",
    "Use `os.remove()` to delete a file.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Example:**\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "os.remove('renamed_example.txt')  # Deletes 'renamed_example.txt'\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**Deleting a Directory:**\n",
    "\n",
    "Use `os.rmdir()` to delete an empty directory, or `shutil.rmtree()` from the `shutil` module to delete a directory and all its contents.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Example:**\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "os.rmdir('new_directory')  # Deletes 'new_directory' if it is empty\n",
    "\n",
    "import shutil\n",
    "shutil.rmtree('new_directory')  # Deletes 'new_directory' and all its contents\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
