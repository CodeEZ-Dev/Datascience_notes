    "## If statement\n",
    "\n",
    "An `if` statement in Python is a conditional statement that allows you to execute a block of code only if a specified condition is true. If the condition is false, the code inside the `if` block is skipped. The `if` statement is a fundamental part of control flow in programming, enabling decision-making in code.\n",

    "## While construct \n",
    "\n",
    "The `while` construct in Python is a control flow statement that allows you to execute a block of code repeatedly as long as a specified condition remains true. It is typically used when the number of iterations is not known beforehand and the loop needs to run until a certain condition changes.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Syntax of a while Loop\n",

    "while condition:\n",

    "count = 1\n",
    "while count <= 5:\n",
    "    print(count)\n",
    "    count += 1\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "In this example, the numbers 1 through 5 will be printed. The variable `count` starts at 1 and is incremented by 1 on each iteration. The loop continues to run as long as `count` is less than or equal to 5.\n",
    "\n",
    "### while-else Statement\n",
    "\n",
    "Python also supports an optional `else` clause with the `while` loop. The `else` block is executed when the loop condition becomes false.\n",

    "while condition:\n",
    "    # code to execute repeatedly as long as condition is true\n",

    "\n",
    "### Infinite while Loop\n",
    "\n",
    "A `while` loop can run indefinitely if the condition never becomes false. This is known as an infinite loop and can be useful in certain scenarios, such as waiting for user input or a condition to be met.\n",
    "\n",

    "# Example: Infinite loop (use with caution)\n",
    "while True:\n",
    "    print(\"This will print forever\")\n",

    "\n",
    "To avoid infinite loops, ensure the loop condition will eventually become false or use a `break` statement to exit the loop.\n",

    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "count = 1\n",

    "    print(count)\n",
    "    count += 1\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "In this example, the loop will print the numbers 1 and 2. When `count` becomes 3, the `break` statement will exit the loop.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Example of Using continue in a while Loop\n",
    "\n",
    "The `continue` statement skips the rest of the code inside the loop for the current iteration and moves to the next iteration.\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "count = 0\n",
    "while count < 5:\n",
    "    count += 1\n",

    "        continue\n",
    "    print(count)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "In this example, the loop will print the numbers 1, 2, 4, and 5. When `count` is 3, the `continue` statement will skip the print statement and move to the next iteration.\n",

    "\n",
    "- **Repeated User Input**: When you need to keep asking the user for input until they provide a valid response.\n",

    "By using `pass`, you can focus on the big picture of your code, ensuring the program's structure is in place before filling in the details. This helps in planning and organizing your code effectively."

    "## Switch statement\n",
    "\n",
    "Python does not have a built-in `switch` statement like some other programming languages (e.g., C, C++, Java). However, similar functionality can be achieved using dictionaries, if-elif-else chains, or other methods. Here are several ways to implement a `switch`-like construct in Python:\n",
    "\n",
    "### Using if-elif-else Chains\n",
    "\n",
    "The most straightforward way to mimic a `switch` statement in Python is by using an `if-elif-else` chain.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Example: Using if-elif-else\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "def switch_case(value):\n",
    "    if value == 1:\n",
    "        return \"Case 1\"\n",
    "    elif value == 2:\n",

    "print(switch_case(1))  # Output: Case 1\n",
    "print(switch_case(4))  # Output: Default case\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Using Dictionaries for Switch-like Behavior\n",
    "\n",
    "A more Pythonic way to achieve `switch`-like behavior is to use a dictionary to map cases to functions.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Example: Using a Dictionary\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "def case_1():\n",
    "    return \"Case 1\"\n",
    "\n",
    "def case_2():\n",
    "    return \"Case 2\"\n",

    "\n",
    "### Using Lambda Functions with Dictionaries\n",
    "\n",
    "You can also use lambda functions in a dictionary to create inline cases without defining separate functions.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Example: Using Lambda Functions\n",

    "## Boxing and Unboxing \n",
    "\n",
    "In programming, \"boxing\" and \"unboxing\" refer to the process of converting between value types (primitive types) and reference types (objects). These concepts are more common in languages like C# and Java. In Python, due to its dynamic and high-level nature, the concepts of boxing and unboxing are not explicitly used or needed in the same way. However, understanding these concepts can be useful, especially if you come from a background in other programming languages.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Boxing and Unboxing in Python\n",
    "\n",
    "In Python, all values are objects, so there isn't a strict distinction between primitive types and objects like there is in some other languages. However, the concepts can be loosely related to how Python handles certain types of conversions and interactions.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Boxing\n",
    "\n",
    "Boxing in other languages refers to wrapping a primitive value in an object so it can be treated as an object. In Python, since everything is an object, you can think of boxing as simply using or creating objects from values.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Example: Implicit Boxing\n",
    "\n",
    "When you create an integer in Python, it's already an object.\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "# Creating an integer object\n",
    "a = 10\n",
    "print(type(a))  # Output: <class 'int'>\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Example: Explicit Boxing (Not Really Needed in Python)\n",
    "\n",
    "You can use functions or classes to wrap values in objects, although this isn't necessary for basic types.\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "# Explicitly wrapping a value in a custom object\n",
    "class BoxedInt:\n",
    "    def __init__(self, value):\n",
    "        self.value = value\n",
    "\n",
    "b = BoxedInt(10)\n",
    "print(b.value)  # Output: 10\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Unboxing\n",
    "\n",
    "Unboxing refers to extracting the primitive value from an object. In Python, since all values are objects, unboxing isn't a common term. However, accessing the underlying value of a custom object can be thought of as unboxing.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Example: Accessing a Value (Unboxing in Custom Context)\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "# Unboxing the value from the custom object\n",
    "print(b.value)  # Output: 10\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Python's Dynamic Typing\n",
    "\n",
    "Python's dynamic typing and high-level abstraction mean that boxing and unboxing are handled automatically. You typically don't need to worry about these processes as you might in statically typed languages.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Example: Automatic Type Handling\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "# Python automatically handles different types and conversions\n",
    "x = 42  # int\n",
    "y = 3.14  # float\n",
    "z = str(x)  # converting int to string (boxing-like concept)\n",
    "\n",
    "print(type(x))  # Output: <class 'int'>\n",
    "print(type(y))  # Output: <class 'float'>\n",
    "print(type(z))  # Output: <class 'str'>\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Key Points\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Boxing and Unboxing in Python**: Python handles values as objects by default, so explicit boxing and unboxing are not common.\n",
    "- **Implicit Conversion**: Python's dynamic typing system automatically manages the conversion between types, akin to boxing and unboxing.\n",
    "- **Custom Objects**: You can create custom objects to encapsulate values, and accessing these values can be seen as unboxing.\n",
    "\n",
    "By understanding these concepts, you can appreciate Python's dynamic nature and how it simplifies the handling of different types, reducing the need for explicit boxing and unboxing operations."
