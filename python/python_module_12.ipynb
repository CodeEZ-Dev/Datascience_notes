    "### Python Threading and Multi-Threading Concepts\n",
    "\n",
    "Threading in Python refers to the ability of a program to manage and utilize threads for concurrent execution. Threads are lightweight subprocesses that run within the context of a main process, allowing tasks to be performed concurrently. Python's `threading` module provides a high-level interface for working with threads.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Threading Basics\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Creating and Starting Threads\n",
    "\n",
    "To use threads in Python, you typically create a new `Thread` object and provide it with a target function that the thread will execute.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Example:**\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "import threading\n",
    "import time\n",
    "\n",
    "# Define a function for the thread to execute\n",
    "def print_numbers():\n",
    "    for i in range(5):\n",
    "        print(f\"Thread: {threading.current_thread().name}, Count: {i}\")\n",
    "        time.sleep(1)\n",
    "\n",
    "# Create and start a thread\n",
    "thread = threading.Thread(target=print_numbers)\n",
    "thread.start()\n",
    "\n",
    "# Main thread continues to execute concurrently\n",
    "for i in range(5):\n",
    "    print(f\"Main Thread: Count: {i}\")\n",
    "    time.sleep(1)\n",
    "\n",
    "# Wait for the thread to complete\n",
    "thread.join()\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "In this example:\n",
    "- We define a function `print_numbers()` that prints numbers in a loop.\n",
    "- We create a `Thread` object `thread` with `target=print_numbers` and start it with `thread.start()`.\n",
    "- Both the main thread and the `thread` execute concurrently, printing numbers in their respective loops.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Thread Synchronization with `Lock`\n",
    "\n",
    "When multiple threads access shared resources (like variables or files), thread synchronization is necessary to prevent race conditions. Python provides a `Lock` object from the `threading` module for this purpose.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Example:**\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "import threading\n",
    "\n",
    "shared_resource = 0\n",
    "lock = threading.Lock()\n",
    "\n",
    "def increment_shared_resource():\n",
    "    global shared_resource\n",
    "    lock.acquire()\n",
    "    try:\n",
    "        shared_resource += 1\n",
    "        print(f\"Thread: {threading.current_thread().name}, Shared Resource: {shared_resource}\")\n",
    "    finally:\n",
    "        lock.release()\n",
    "\n",
    "# Create multiple threads\n",
    "threads = []\n",
    "for i in range(5):\n",
    "    thread = threading.Thread(target=increment_shared_resource)\n",
    "    threads.append(thread)\n",
    "    thread.start()\n",
    "\n",
    "# Wait for all threads to complete\n",
    "for thread in threads:\n",
    "    thread.join()\n",
    "\n",
    "print(\"Final Shared Resource:\", shared_resource)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "In this example:\n",
    "- We define a shared resource `shared_resource` and a `Lock` object `lock`.\n",
    "- The `increment_shared_resource()` function increments `shared_resource` under the protection of the `lock` using `lock.acquire()` and `lock.release()`.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Multi-Threading vs. Multi-Processing\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Multi-Threading:** Threads share the same memory space, making communication between threads faster and more efficient. However, due to Python's Global Interpreter Lock (GIL), only one thread can execute Python bytecode at a time.\n",
    "  \n",
    "- **Multi-Processing:** Processes have separate memory spaces, so each process runs independently. Python's `multiprocessing` module allows true parallelism, utilizing multiple CPU cores effectively. Communication between processes is more complex than between threads.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Thread Pooling with `ThreadPoolExecutor`\n",
    "\n",
    "Python provides `concurrent.futures.ThreadPoolExecutor` for managing a pool of threads and executing tasks asynchronously.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Example:**\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "from concurrent.futures import ThreadPoolExecutor\n",
    "import time\n",
    "\n",
    "def task(message):\n",
    "    print(f\"Executing task: {message}\")\n",
    "    time.sleep(2)\n",
    "    return f\"Task {message} done\"\n",
    "\n",
    "# Create a ThreadPoolExecutor with 3 threads\n",
    "with ThreadPoolExecutor(max_workers=3) as executor:\n",
    "    # Submit tasks to the executor\n",
    "    futures = [executor.submit(task, i) for i in range(5)]\n",
    "\n",
    "    # Wait for all tasks to complete and retrieve results\n",
    "    for future in futures:\n",
    "        print(future.result())\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "In this example:\n",
    "- We create a `ThreadPoolExecutor` with `max_workers=3`.\n",
    "- We submit 5 tasks to the executor using `executor.submit()`.\n",
    "- Each task sleeps for 2 seconds and returns a message.\n"
