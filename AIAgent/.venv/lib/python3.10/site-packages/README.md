When I first found FastAPI, I got it immediately. I was excited to find something so innovative and ergonomic built on Pydantic.

Virtually every Agent Framework and LLM library in Python uses Pydantic, but when we began to use LLMs in [Pydantic Logfire](https://pydantic.dev/logfire), I couldn't find anything that gave me the same feeling.

PydanticAI is a Python Agent Framework designed to make it less painful to build production grade applications with Generative AI.

## Why use PydanticAI

* Built by the team behind Pydantic (the validation layer of the OpenAI SDK, the Anthropic SDK, LangChain, LlamaIndex, AutoGPT, Transformers, CrewAI, Instructor and many more)
* Model-agnostic â€” currently OpenAI, Gemini, and Groq are supported. And there is a simple interface to implement support for other models.
* [Type-safe](https://ai.pydantic.dev/agents/#static-type-checking)
* Control flow and agent composition is done with vanilla Python, allowing you to make use of the same Python development best practices you'd use in any other (non-AI) project
* [Structured response](https://ai.pydantic.dev/results/#structured-result-validation) validation with Pydantic
* [Streamed responses](https://ai.pydantic.dev/results/#streamed-results), including validation of streamed _structured_ responses with Pydantic
* Novel, type-safe [dependency injection system](https://ai.pydantic.dev/dependencies/), useful for testing and eval-driven iterative development
* [Logfire integration](https://ai.pydantic.dev/logfire/) for debugging and monitoring the performance and general behavior of your LLM-powered application

## example "In Beta"

PydanticAI is in early beta, the API is still subject to change and there's a lot more to do.
[Feedback](https://github.com/pydantic/pydantic-ai/issues) is very welcome!

## Hello World Example

Here's a minimal example of PydanticAI:

```py
from pydantic_ai import Agent

agent = Agent(  # (1)!
    'gemini-1.5-flash',
    system_prompt='Be concise, reply with one sentence.',
)

result = agent.run_sync('Where does "hello world" come from?')
print(result.data)
"""
The first known use of "hello, world" was in a 1974 textbook about the C programming language.
"""
```

_(This example is complete, it can be run "as is")_

Not very interesting yet, but we can easily add "tools", dynamic system prompts, and structured responses to build more powerful agents.

## Tools & Dependency Injection Example

Here is a concise example using PydanticAI to build a support agent for a bank:

**(Better documented example [in the docs](https://ai.pydantic.dev/#tools-dependency-injection-example))**

```py
from dataclasses import dataclass

from pydantic import BaseModel, Field
from pydantic_ai import Agent, RunContext

from bank_database import DatabaseConn


@dataclass
class SupportDependencies:
    customer_id: int
    db: DatabaseConn


class SupportResult(BaseModel):
    support_advice: str = Field(description='Advice returned to the customer')
    block_card: bool = Field(description="Whether to block the customer's card")
    risk: int = Field(description='Risk level of query', ge=0, le=10)


support_agent = Agent(
    'openai:gpt-4o',
    deps_type=SupportDependencies,
    result_type=SupportResult,
    system_prompt=(
        'You are a support agent in our bank, give the '
        'customer support and judge the risk level of their query.'
    ),
)


@support_agent.system_prompt
async def add_customer_name(ctx: RunContext[SupportDependencies]) -> str:
    customer_name = await ctx.deps.db.customer_name(id=ctx.deps.customer_id)
    return f"The customer's name is {customer_name!r}"


@support_agent.tool
async def customer_balance(
    ctx: RunContext[SupportDependencies], include_pending: bool
) -> str:
    """Returns the customer's current account balance."""
    balance = await ctx.deps.db.customer_balance(
        id=ctx.deps.customer_id,
        include_pending=include_pending,
    )
    return f'${balance:.2f}'


...


async def main():
    deps = SupportDependencies(customer_id=123, db=DatabaseConn())
    result = await support_agent.run('What is my balance?', deps=deps)
    print(result.data)
    """
    support_advice='Hello John, your current account balance, including pending transactions, is $123.45.' block_card=False risk=1
    """

    result = await support_agent.run('I just lost my card!', deps=deps)
    print(result.data)
    """
    support_advice="I'm sorry to hear that, John. We are temporarily blocking your card to prevent unauthorized transactions." block_card=True risk=8
    """
```
