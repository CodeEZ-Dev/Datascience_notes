    "## Python Logging\n",
    "Logging is a crucial aspect of any application, providing a way to track events, errors, and operational information. Python's built-in logging module offers a flexible framework for emitting log messages from Python programs. In this lesson, we will cover the basics of logging, including how to configure logging, log levels, and best practices for using logging in Python applications."
